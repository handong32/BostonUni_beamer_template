%% Methodology

%% overview
\begin{frame}
\only<1>{
\frametitle{Core Ideas}
There are three aspects of a system that impact the performance and energy of application packet processing: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Efficiency of OS networking paths.
    \item Batching of incoming packets.
    \item Frequency of the processor.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{figure}

\note{
\begin{itemize}
    \item OS Efficiency - library OS, unikernels, kernel bypass techniques
    \item Packet Batch - Frequently done by software, coalesce packets, throttle
    \item Processor Frequency - speed of processor impacts instruction execution, use less energy with slow processor

%% EbbRT
\begin{frame}{Specialized OS}
\framesubtitle{Mechanism}
EbbRT~\cite{ebbrt}, a framework for building per-application library OSes, is used as a mechanism to explore how specialized systems are able to exploit these hardware settings:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Event-driven system
    \item Run-to-completion off a single interrupt
    \item Application and kernel code run in the same domain
    \item Zero-copy of all device buffers to application
    \item 20K lines of code

    \begin{column}{.5\textwidth}
        \begin{enumerate}
        %{As interrupt delay (1) is increased, the receive queue (2) buffers more incoming packets as the NIC cannot fire new interrupts until the delay value has been reached. Once the interrupt is fired, Linux's NAPI polling mechanism kicks in and starts pulling in new packets (3) to be processed until it either reaches its current work budget (calculated using existing jiffies) or until there is no more data to be processed.
            \item set ITR to some value
            \item receive queue buffers incoming packets until ITR value has been reached
            \item NIC fires interrupt and packets gets processed by software

%% DVFS
\begin{frame}{Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling (DVFS)}
\framesubtitle{Mechanism}
Control processor frequency and energy, commonly defined as:
\[ P = C f V^2 + P_{static} \]

Hardware values: 1.3 GHz - 2.9 GHz, units of 0.1 GHz.
Trades off instruction execution speed with reduction in energy use. Interacts with both ITR and efficiency of the system.
\end{frame}
\note{
\begin{itemize}
    \item P Is the dynamic power
    \item C Is the switching capacitance (Capacitance is the ability of a component or circuit to collect and store energy in the form of an electrical charge) of the logic circuit 
    \item V Is the operational voltage.
    \item f Is the operational frequency
    \item linear relationship between power consumption and operational frequency.
    \item ITR can batch a lot of work, but do you want to do that if DVFS is slow
    \item  Given a efficient system (i.e. less code to run, more optimized paths), can push DVFS lower to lower energy without sacrificing performance

\begin{itemize}
    \item  \small The lowest point in this 'V' shape represents a setting that used the lowest energy while being competitive in performance; the vertical points above represent other configurations that sacrifice energy for better performance. We also note that Linux with dynamic settings always lies to the right of the 'V' curve, indicating the value of doing such a static search
    \item \small ITR value is used to effectively determine how much payload the software should process in a fixed quantum. With much larger message sizes, portions of its payload being transmitted over the wire and processed by software asynchronously. The values which yield best efficiency is indicating a "sweet spot" in which the software should pace packet processing and save energy by sleeping during the its idle periods
    \item \small applications such as video streaming or a middle tier service within a data center that have a predictable and constant data transmission

            \item Always an optimal static ITR, DVFS than default algorithms
            \item Specializing OS magnify both performance and energy
            \item Use insights from Linux results to explore new points in OS specialize space - polling

% Exploiting OS specialization to do guided by data driven results to explore new points in this space
% As an example, we use polling
