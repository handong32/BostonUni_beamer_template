    job arrivals are only triggered by job completions (followed by think time), or an
    open system model, where new jobs arrive independently of job completions. In general,
    system designers pay little attention to whether a workload generator is closed or
    open.Using a combination of implementation and simulation experiments, we illustrate
    that there is a vast difference in behavior between open and closed models in real-world
    settings. We synthesize these differences into eight simple guiding principles, which
    serve three purposes. First, the principles specify how scheduling policies are impacted
    by closed and open models, and explain the differences in user level performance.
    Second, the principles motivate the use of partly open system models, whose behavior
    we show to lie between that of closed and open models. Finally, the principles provide
    guidelines to system designers for determining which system model is most appropriate
    for a given workload.},

abstract = {The gap is widening between the processor clock speed of end-system architectures
and network throughput capabilities. It is now physically possible to provide single-flow
throughput of speeds up to 100 Gbps, and 400 Gbps will soon be possible. Most current
research into high-speed data networking focuses on managing expanding network capabilities
within datacenter Local Area Networks (LANs) or efficiently multiplexing millions
of relatively small flows through a Wide Area Network (WAN). However, datacenter hyper-convergence
places high-throughput networking workloads on general-purpose hardware, and distributed
High-Performance Computing (HPC) applications require time-sensitive, high-throughput
end-to-end flows (also referred to as “elephant flows”) to occur over WANs. For these
applications, the bottleneck is often the end-system and not the intervening network.
Since the problem of the end-system bottleneck was uncovered, many techniques have
been developed which address this mismatch with varying degrees of effectiveness.
In this survey, we describe the most promising techniques, beginning with network
architectures and NIC design, continuing with operating and end-system architectures,
and concluding with clean-slate protocol design.},

abstract = {Traditional end-host network stacks are struggling to keep up with rapidly increasing datacenter access link bandwidths due to their unsustainable CPU overheads. Motivated by this, our community is exploring a multitude of solutions for future network stacks: from Linux kernel optimizations to partial hardware offload to clean-slate userspace stacks to specialized host network hardware. The design space explored by these solutions would benefit from a detailed understanding of CPU inefficiencies in existing network stacks.This paper presents measurement and insights for Linux kernel network stack performance for 100Gbps access link bandwidths. Our study reveals that such high bandwidth links, coupled with relatively stagnant technology trends for other host resources (e.g., CPU speeds and capacity, cache sizes, NIC buffer sizes, etc.), mark a fundamental shift in host network stack bottlenecks. For instance, we find that a single core is no longer able to process packets at line rate, with data copy from kernel to application buffers at the receiver becoming the core performance bottleneck. In addition, increase in bandwidth-delay products have outpaced the increase in cache sizes, resulting in inefficient DMA pipeline between the NIC and the CPU. Finally, we find that traditional loosely-coupled design of network stack and CPU schedulers in existing operating systems becomes a limiting factor in scaling network stack performance across cores. Based on insights from our study, we discuss implications to design of future operating systems, network protocols, and host hardware.},

abstract = {Today's datacenters demand high-performance, energy-efficient software data planes, which are widely used in many areas including fast network packet processing, network function virtualization, high-speed data transfer in storage systems, and I/O virtualization. Modern software data planes bypass OS I/O stacks and rely on cores spinning on user-level queues as a fast notification mechanism. Whereas spin-polling can improve latency and throughput, it entails significant shortcomings, especially when scaling to large numbers of cores/queues. In this paper, we pinpoint and quantify challenges of spin-polling--based software data planes using Intel's Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) as a representative infrastructure. We characterize four scalability issues of software data planes: (1) Full-tilt spinning cores perform more (useless) polling work when there is less work pending in the queues; (2) Spin-polling scales poorly with the number of polled queues due to processor cache capacity constraints, especially when traffic is unbalanced; (3) Operation rate limits (transactions per second) as well as a Polling Tax (the overhead of polling, which is considerable even when operating at saturation throughput) result in poor core scalability. (4) Whereas shared queues can mitigate load imbalance and head-of-line-blocking, synchronization overheads limit their potential benefits. We identify root causes of these issues and discuss solution directions to improve hardware and software abstractions for better performance, efficiency, and scalability in software data planes.},

abstract = {Energy consumption has become a major concern for all computing systems, from servers in data-centres to mobile phones. Processor manufacturers have reacted to this by implementing power-management mechanisms in the hardware and researchers have investigated how operating systems can make use of those mechanisms to minimise energy consumption. Much of this research has focused on a single class of systems and compute-intensive workloads.Missing is an examination of how much energy can actually be saved when running realistic workloads on different classes of systems. This paper compares the effects of using dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) and sleep states on platforms using server, desktop and embedded processors. It also analyses workloads that represent real-world uses of those systems. In these circumstances, we find that usage of power-management mechanisms is not clear-cut, and that it is critical to analyse the system as a whole, including the workload, to determine whether using mechanisms such as DVFS will be effective at reducing energy consumption.},

abstract = {Online Search (OLS) is a key component of many popular Internet services. Datacenters running OLS consume significant amounts of energy. However, reducing their energy is challenging due to their tight response time requirements. A key aspect of OLS is that each user query goes to all or many of the nodes in the cluster, so that the overall time budget is dictated by the tail of the replies' latency distribution; replies see latency variations both in the network and compute. Previous work proposes to achieve load-proportional energy by slowing down the computation at lower datacenter loads based directly on response times (i.e., at lower loads, the proposal exploits the average slack in the time budget provisioned for the peak load). In contrast, we propose TimeTrader to reduce energy by exploiting the latency slack in the sub-critical replies which arrive before the deadline (e.g., 80% of replies are 3-4x faster than the tail). This slack is present at all loads and subsumes the previous work's load-related slack. While the previous work shifts the leaves' response time distribution to consume the slack at lower loads, TimeTrader reshapes the distribution at all loads by slowing down individual sub-critical nodes without increasing missed deadlines. TimeTrader exploits slack in both the network and compute budgets. Further, TimeTrader leverages Earliest Deadline First scheduling to largely decouple critical requests from the queuing delays of sub-critical requests which can then be slowed down without hurting critical requests. A combination of real-system measurements and at-scale simulations shows that without adding to missed deadlines, TimeTrader saves 15% and 40% energy at 90% and 30% loading, respectively, in a datacenter with 512 nodes, whereas previous work saves 0% and 30%. Further, as a proof-of-concept, we build a small-scale real implementation to evaluate TimeTrader and show 10-30% energy savings.},

abstract = {The conventional wisdom is that aggressive networking requirements, such as high packet rates for small messages and microsecond-scale tail latency, are best addressed outside the kernel, in a user-level networking stack. We present IX, a dataplane operating system that provides high I/O performance, while maintaining the key advantage of strong protection offered by existing kernels. IX uses hardware virtualization to separate management and scheduling functions of the kernel (control plane) from network processing (dataplane). The data-plane architecture builds upon a native, zero-copy API and optimizes for both bandwidth and latency by dedicating hardware threads and networking queues to data-plane instances, processing bounded batches of packets to completion, and by eliminating coherence traffic and multi-core synchronization. We demonstrate that IX outperforms Linux and state-of-the-art, user-space network stacks significantly in both throughput and end-to-end latency. Moreover, IX improves the throughput of a widely deployed, key-value store by up to 3.6x and reduces tail latency by more than 2x.},

abstract = {Recent device hardware trends enable a new approach to the design of network server operating systems. In a traditional operating system, the kernel mediates access to device hardware by server applications to enforce process isolation as well as network and disk security. We have designed and implemented a new operating system, Arrakis, that splits the traditional role of the kernel in two. Applications have direct access to virtualized I/O devices, allowing most I/O operations to skip the kernel entirely, while the kernel is re-engineered to provide network and disk protection without kernel mediation of every operation. We describe the hardware and software changes needed to take advantage of this new abstraction, and we illustrate its power by showing improvements of 2 to 5 \texttimes{} in latency and 9 \texttimes{} throughput for a popular persistent NoSQL store relative to a well-tuned Linux implementation.},

abstract = {Process variability from a range of sources is growing as technology scales below 65nm, resulting in increasingly nonuniform transistor delay and leakage power both within a die and across dies. As a result, the negative impact of process variations on the maximum operating frequency and the total power consumption of a processor is expected to worsen. Meanwhile, manufacturers have integrated more cores in a single die, substantially improving the throughput of a processor running highly-parallel applications. However, many existing applications do not have high enough parallelism to exploit multiple cores in a die. In this paper, first, we analyze the throughput impact of applying per-core power gating and dynamic voltage and frequency scaling to power- and thermal-constrained multicore processors. To optimize the throughput of the multicore processors running applications with limited parallelism, we exploit power- and thermal-headroom resulted from power-gated idle cores, allowing active cores to increase operating frequency through supply voltage scaling. Our analysis using a 32nm predictive technology model shows that optimizing the number of active cores and operating frequency within power, thermal, and supply voltage scaling limits improves the throughput of a 16-core processor by ~16%. Furthermore, we extend our throughput analysis and optimization to consider the impact of within-die process variations leading to core-to-core frequency (and leakage power) variations in a multicore processor. Our analysis shows that exploiting core-to-core frequency variations improves the throughput of a 16-core processor by ~75%.},

    abstract = {We propose a new design for highly concurrent Internet services, which we call the staged event-driven architecture (SEDA). SEDA is intended to support massive concurrency demands and simplify the construction of well-conditioned services. In SEDA, applications consist of a network of event-driven stages connected by explicit queues. This architecture allows services to be well-conditioned to load, preventing resources from being overcommitted when demand exceeds service capacity. SEDA makes use of a set of dynamic resource controllers to keep stages within their operating regime despite large fluctuations in load. We describe several control mechanisms for automatic tuning and load conditioning, including thread pool sizing, event batching, and adaptive load shedding. We present the SEDA design and an implementation of an Internet services platform based on this architecture. We evaluate the use of SEDA through two applications: a high-performance HTTP server and a packet router for the Gnutella peer-to-peer file sharing network. These results show that SEDA applications exhibit higher performance than traditional service designs, and are robust to huge variations in load.},

abstract = {We present Continuously Adaptive Dynamic Voltage/Frequency scaling in Linux systems running on Intel i7 and AMD Phenom II processors. By exploiting slack, inherent in memory-bound programs, our approach aims to improve power efficiency even when the processor does not sit idle. Our underlying methodology is based on a simple first-order processor performance model in which frequency scaling is expressed as a change (in cycles) of the main memory latency. Utilizing available monitoring hardware we show that our model is powerful enough to i) predict with reasonable accuracy the effect of frequency scaling (in terms of performance loss) and ii) predict the core energy under different V/f combinations. To validate our approach we perform highly accurate, fine-grained power measurements directly on the off-chip voltage regulators. We use our model to implement various DVFS policies as Linux "green" governors to continuously optimize for various power-efficiency metrics such as EDP or ED^2P, or achieve energy savings with a user-specified limit on performance loss. Our evaluation shows that, for SPEC2006 workloads, our governors achieve dynamically the same optimal EDP or ED$^2$P (within 2% on avg.) as an exhaustive search of all possible frequencies. Energy savings can reach up to 56% in memory-bound workloads with corresponding improvements of about 55% for EDP or ED$^2$P.},

abstract = {Recently, a single chip multiprocessor (CMP) is becoming an attractive architecture for improving throughput of program execution. In CMPs, multiple processor cores share several hardware resources such as cache memory and memory bus. Therefore, the resource contention significantly degrades performance of each thread and also loses fairness between threads.In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Frequency and Voltage Scaling (DVFS) algorithm for improving total instruction throughput, fairness, and energy efficiency of CMPs. The proposed technique periodically observes the utilization ratio of shared resources and controls the frequency and the voltage of each processor core individually to balance the ratio between threads. We evaluate our technique and the evaluation results show that fairness between threads are greatly improved by the technique. Moreover, the total instruction throughput increases in many cases while reducing energy consumption.},

abstract = {The ability to cap peak power consumption is a desirable feature in modern data centers for energy budgeting, cost management, and efficient power delivery. Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) is a traditional control knob in the tradeoff between server power and performance. Multi-core processors and the parallel applications that take advantage of them introduce new possibilities for control, wherein workload threads are packed onto a variable number of cores and idle cores enter low-power sleep states. This paper proposes Pack & Cap, a control technique designed to make optimal DVFS and thread packing control decisions in order to maximize performance within a power budget. In order to capture the workload dependence of the performance-power Pareto frontier, a multinomial logistic regression (MLR) classifier is built using a large volume of performance counter, temperature, and power characterization data. When queried during runtime, the classifier is capable of accurately selecting the optimal operating point. We implement and validate this method on a real quad-core system running the PARSEC parallel benchmark suite. When varying the power budget during runtime, Pack & Cap meets power constraints 82% of the time even in the absence of a power measuring device. The addition of thread packing to DVFS as a control knob increases the range of feasible power constraints by an average of 21% when compared to DVFS alone and reduces workload energy consumption by an average of 51.6% compared to existing control techniques that achieve the same power range.},

abstract = {Recent Intel processors support the Running Average Power Level (RAPL) interface,
which among other things provides estimated energy measurements for the CPUs, integrated
GPU, and DRAM. These measurements are easily accessible by the user, and can be gathered
by a wide variety of tools, including the Linux perf_event interface. This allows
unprecedented easy access to energy information when designing and optimizing energy-aware
code.While greatly useful, on most systems these RAPL measurements are estimated values,
generated on the fly by an on-chip energy model. The values are not documented well,
and the results (especially the DRAM results) have undergone only limited validation.We
validate the DRAM RAPL results on both desktop and server Haswell machines, with multiple
types of DDR3 and DDR4 memory. We instrument the hardware to gather actual power measurements
and compare them to the RAPL values returned via Linux perf_event. We describe the
many challenges encountered when instrumenting systems for detailed power measurement.We
find that the RAPL results match overall energy and power trends, usually by a constant
power offset. The results match best when the DRAM is being heavily utilized, but
do not match as well in cases where the system is idle, or when an integrated GPU
is using the memory.We also verify that Haswell server machines produce more accurate
results, as they include actual power measurements gathered through the integrated
voltage regulator.},

abstract = {This paper presents a system-level method for achieving the rapid deployment and high-density
caching of serverless functions in a FaaS environment. For reduced start times, functions
are deployed from unikernel snapshots, bypassing expensive initialization steps. To
reduce the memory footprint of snapshots we apply page-level sharing across the entire
software stack that is required to run a function. We demonstrate the effects of our
techniques by replacing Linux on the compute node of a FaaS platform architecture.
With our prototype OS, the deployment time of a function drops from 100s of milliseconds
to under 10 ms. Platform throughput improves by 51x on workload composed entirely
of new functions. We are able to cache over 50,000 function instances in memory as
opposed to 3,000 using standard OS techniques. In combination, these improvements
give the FaaS platform a new ability to handle large-scale bursts of requests.},

We present a general formulation of this problem as a linear program, discuss several potential heuristic solutions, and evaluate these heuristics on two real systems (one purchased in 2010, the other in 2013). We find that the well-known race-to-idle heuristic is close to the optimal solution on the older machine. On the newer machine, however, the optimal solution outperforms race-to-idle by over 35%. A generalization of race-to-idle, called pace-to-idle, is found to provide better results in a wider range of scenarios.},

abstract = {Numerous data center services exhibit low average utilization leading to poor energy efficiency. Although CPU voltage and frequency scaling historically has been an effective means to scale down power with utilization, transistor scaling trends are limiting its effectiveness and the CPU is accounting for a shrinking fraction of system power. Recent research advocates the use of full-system idle low-power modes to combat energy losses, as such modes provide the deepest power savings with bounded response time impact. However, the trend towards increasing cores per die is undermining the effectiveness of these sleep modes, particularly for request-parallel data center applications, because the independent idle periods across individual cores are unlikely to align by happenstance.We propose DreamWeaver, architectural support to facilitate deep sleep for request-parallel applications on multicore servers. DreamWeaver comprises two elements: Weave Scheduling, a scheduling policy to coalesce idle and busy periods across cores to create opportunities for system-wide deep sleep; and the Dream Processor, a light-weight co-processor that monitors incoming network traffic and suspended work during sleep to determine when the system must wake. DreamWeaver is based on two key concepts: (1) stall execution and sleep anytime any core is unoccupied, but (2) constrain the maximum time any request may be stalled. Unlike prior scheduling approaches, DreamWeaver will preempt execution to sleep, maximizing time spent at the systems' most efficient operating point. We demonstrate that DreamWeaver can smoothly trade-off bounded, predictable increases in 99th-percentile response time for increasing power savings, and strictly dominates the savings available with voltage and frequency scaling and timeout-based request batching schemes.},

abstract = {Chip-level power and thermal implications will continue to rule as one of the primary design constraints and performance limiters. The gap between average and peak power actually widens with increased levels of core integration. As such, if per-core control of power levels (modes) is possible, a global power manager should be able to dynamically set the modes suitably. This would be done in tune with the workload characteristics, in order to always maintain a chip-level power that is below the specified budget. Furthermore, this should be possible without significant degradation of chip-level throughput performance. We analyze and validate this concept in detail in this paper. We assume a per-core DVFS (dynamic voltage and frequency scaling) knob to be available to such a conceptual global power manager. We evaluate several different policies for global multi-core power management. In this analysis, we consider various different objectives such as prioritization and optimized throughput. Overall, our results show that in the context of a workload comprised of SPEC benchmark threads, our best architected policies can come within 1% of the performance of an ideal oracle, while meeting a given chip-level power budget. Furthermore, we show that these global dynamic management policies perform significantly better than static management, even if static scheduling is given oracular knowledge.},

abstract = {Recent I/O technologies such as PCI-Express and 10Gb Ethernet enable unprecedented
levels of I/O bandwidths in mainstream platforms. However, in traditional architectures,
memory latency alone can limit processors from matching 10 Gb inbound network I/O
traffic. We propose a platform-wide method called Direct Cache Access (DCA) to deliver
inbound I/O data directly into processor caches. We demonstrate that DCA provides
a significant reduction in memory latency and memory bandwidth for receive intensive
network I/O applications. Analysis of benchmarks such as SPECWeb9, TPC-W and TPC-C
shows that overall benefit depends on the relative volume of I/O to memory traffic
as well as the spatial and temporal relationship between processor and I/O memory
accesses. A system level perspective for the efficient implementation of DCA is presented.},

    abstract = {Power dissipation limits have emerged as a major constraint in the design of microprocessors. This is true not only at the low end, where cost and battery life are the primary drivers, but also now at the midrange and high-end system (server) level. Thus, the ability to estimate power consumption at the high level, during the early-stage definition and trade-off studies is a key new methodology enhancement sought by design and performance architects. We first review the fundamentals in terms of power estimation and power-performance trade-offs at the microarchitecture level. We then discuss the opportunities of saving power that can be exposed via microarchitecture-level modeling. In particular, the potential savings that can be effected through straightforward clock-gating techniques is cited as an example. We also describe some future ideas and trends in power-efficient processor design. Examples of how microarchitectural observations can be used toward power-saving circuit design optimizations are described. The design and modeling challenges are in the context of work in progress within IBM Research. This research is in support of future, high-end processor development within IBM.},

abstract = {Optimizing the performance in multiprogrammed environments, especially for workloads composed of multithreaded programs is a desired feature of runtime management system in future manycore processors. At the same time, power capping capability is required in order to improve the reliability of microprocessor chips while reducing the costs of power supply and thermal budgeting. This paper presents a sophisticated runtime coordinated power-performance management system called C-3PO, which optimizes the performance of manycore processors under a power constraint by controlling two software knobs: thread packing, and dynamic voltage and frequency scaling~(DVFS). The proposed solution distributes the power budget to each program by controlling the workload threads to be executed with appropriate number of cores and operating frequency. The power budget is distributed carefully in different forms (number of allocated cores or operating frequency) depending on the power-performance characteristics of the workload so that each program can effectively convert the power into performance. The proposed system is based on a heuristic algorithm which relies on runtime prediction of power and performance via hardware performance monitoring units. Empirical results on a 64-core platform show that C-3PO well outperforms traditional counterparts across various PARSEC workload mixes.},

abstract = {Servers running in datacenters are commonly kept underutilized to meet stringent latency targets. Due to poor energy-proportionality in commodity servers, the low utilization results in wasteful power consumption that cost millions of dollars. Applying dynamic power management on datacenter workloads is challenging, especially when tail latency requirements often fall in the sub-millisecond level. The fundamental issue is randomness due to unpredictable request arrival times and request service times. Prior techniques applied per-core DVFS to have fine-grain control of slowing down request processing without violating the tail latency target. However, most commodity servers only support per-core DFS, which greatly limits potential energy saving. In this paper, we propose DynSleep, a fine-grain power management scheme for datacenter workloads through the use of per-core sleep states (C-states). DynSleep dynamically postpones the processing of some requests, creating longer idle periods, which allow the use of deeper C-states to save energy. We design and implement DynSleep with Mem-cached, a popular key-value store application used in datacenters. The experimental results show that DynSleep achieves up to 65\% core power saving, and 27\% better than the per-core DVFS power management scheme, while still satisfying the tail latency constraint. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to analyze and develop power management technique with CPU C-states in latency-critical datacenter workloads},

isbn = {9781931971966},
publisher = {USENIX Association},

abstract = {We present MegaPipe, a new API for efficient, scalable network I/O for message-oriented workloads. The design of MegaPipe centers around the abstraction of a channel - a per-core, bidirectional pipe between the kernel and user space, used to exchange both I/O requests and event notifications. On top of the channel abstraction, we introduce three key concepts of MegaPipe: partitioning, lightweight socket (lwsocket), and batching.We implement MegaPipe in Linux and adapt memcached and nginx. Our results show that, by embracing a clean-slate design approach, MegaPipe is able to exploit new opportunities for improved performance and ease of programmability. In microbenchmarks on an 8-core server with 64 B messages, MegaPipe outperforms baseline Linux between 29% (for long connections) and 582% (for short connections). MegaPipe improves the performance of a modified version of memcached between 15% and 320%. For a workload based on real-world HTTP traces, MegaPipe boosts the throughput of nginx by 75%.},

abstract = {Datacenter applications demand microsecond-scale tail latencies and high request rates from operating systems, and most applications handle loads that have high variance over multiple timescales. Achieving these goals in a CPU-efficient way is an open problem. Because of the high overheads of today's kernels, the best available solution to achieve microsecond-scale latencies is kernel-bypass networking, which dedicates CPU cores to applications for spin-polling the network card. But this approach wastes CPU: even at modest average loads, one must dedicate enough cores for the peak expected load.Shenango achieves comparable latencies but at far greater CPU efficiency. It reallocates cores across applications at very fine granularity--every 5 µs--enabling cycles unused by latency-sensitive applications to be used productively by batch processing applications. It achieves such fast reallocation rates with (1) an efficient algorithm that detects when applications would benefit from more cores, and (2) a privileged component called the IOKernel that runs on a dedicated core, steering packets from the NIC and orchestrating core reallocations. When handling latency-sensitive applications, such as memcached, we found that Shenango achieves tail latency and throughput comparable to ZygOS, a state-of-the-art, kernel-bypass network stack, but can linearly trade latency-sensitive application throughput for batch processing application throughput, vastly increasing CPU efficiency.},

abstract = {Since 2005, processor designers have increased core counts to exploit Moore's Law scaling, rather than focusing on single-core performance. The failure of Dennard scaling, to which the shift to multicore parts is partially a response, may soon limit multicore scaling just as single-core scaling has been curtailed. This paper models multicore scaling limits by combining device scaling, single-core scaling, and multicore scaling to measure the speedup potential for a set of parallel workloads for the next five technology generations. For device scaling, we use both the ITRS projections and a set of more conservative device scaling parameters. To model single-core scaling, we combine measurements from over 150 processors to derive Pareto-optimal frontiers for area/performance and power/performance. Finally, to model multicore scaling, we build a detailed performance model of upper-bound performance and lower-bound core power. The multicore designs we study include single-threaded CPU-like and massively threaded GPU-like multicore chip organizations with symmetric, asymmetric, dynamic, and composed topologies. The study shows that regardless of chip organization and topology, multicore scaling is power limited to a degree not widely appreciated by the computing community. Even at 22 nm (just one year from now), 21% of a fixed-size chip must be powered off, and at 8 nm, this number grows to more than 50%. Through 2024, only 7.9x average speedup is possible across commonly used parallel workloads, leaving a nearly 24-fold gap from a target of doubled performance per generation.},
